\section{Definition}

\paragraph{}
\textbf{Brightness Temperature} : The temperature at which a black body in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings would have to be in order to duplicate the observed specific intensity of an object at a frequency v. Often in radio astronomy brightness temperature (TB) is used as a measure of received intensity.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Anvil cloud} : Anvil clouds, which are mostly composed of ice particles, form in the upper parts of thunderstorms. They get their anvil shape from the fact that the rising air in thunderstorms expands and spreads out as the air bumps up against the bottom of the stratosphere. This is because the air in the stratosphere is warmer than the rising air in the anvil, and so prevents the relatively cooler anvil air from rising any farther.

\vspace{0.5cm} 
\textbf{Equivalent reflectivity factor Z and dBZ}: Z expresses the volume of reflector per volume area (unit is mm\textsuperscript{6}.m\textsuperscript{-3}). dBZ is defined by $dBZ= 10.log_{10}(\frac{Z}{Z_{0}})$.

\vspace{0.5cm}
\textbf{Plan position indicator and Range height indicator} : These are the two main types of scans in meteorology. Plan position indicator refers to a scan with a constant elevation and a rotation of the azimuth angle. Range height indicator refers to a constant azimuth angle while the elevation angle varies.

\textbf{Standard reflectivity}:

\textbf{Doppler velocity radar parameters}:

\textbf{Energy dissipation rate (EDR)}
Turbulent flows consist of eddiyes of various size range. The kinetic energy cascades down from large to small eddies by interactionnal forces between the eddies. At very small scale, the energy of the eddies dissipates into heatdue to viscous forces. Energy dissipation rate is the parameter to determine the amount of energy lost by the viscous forces in the turbukent flow.

\raggedright The Chisholm firestorm : observed microstructure, precipitation and lightning activity & D. Rosenfield & 2007 & \raggedleft 
\begin{itemize} 
\item High convective effect leads to injection of smoke in the stratosphere
\item Pyro-Cb are formed of very small drops that are slow to coalesce into rain drops due to large concentration of CCN from the fire smoke and/or the updraft velocity.
\item PyroCb delay rain collaspe and generate updrafts for a longer period, then are favorable to increase fire severity and spotting.
\item Cloud top temperature can be estimated equal to the thermal brightness temperature under certain conditions (low brightness temp differential between 10. and 12 ym)
\end{itemize} 
\tabularnewline

\raggedright Violent pyro-convective storm devastates Australia's capital and pollutes the atmosphere & M.Fromm & 2006 & \raggedleft 
\begin{itemize}
\item Radar data of the pyroCb
\item PyroCb generate an anvil (hard to observe with satellite) 
\item The aerosols in the pyro-Cb will asbord/intercept solar radiation once in the stratosphere
\item Damage consistend with a tornadic event rather than fire whirl for three reasons:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Path dimensions (20km lomg and 450 wide)
	\item Break in the damage path (temporarily lift of the vortex: therefore it wouldn't touche the ground)
	\item Damage extent beyond the burn zone
	\end{itemize}
\item 1dBZ radar contour allows to see the pyroCb can give a good 3D repreentation
\item Fire affects the atmosphere :
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Disturbs the airflow
	\item Injects smoke/heat/emittants
	\end{itemize}	 
\item Atmosphere conditions affect fire: wind/moisture/temperature influence fuel dryness and spotting, control fire behaviour and rate of spread.

\item Radiant heat can be used as an approximation for the fire intensity
\item FRP was maximum in late evening and minimum in the morning
\item Meteorological conditions: 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Long and short term drought
	\item Dry fuel
	\item Low relative humidity (<40\%)
	\item Dry lower troposhere
	\item Upper-level disturbance near the fire associated with critical FRP
	\end{itemize}
\item Low atmospheric fire weather are unable to identify the most extreme fire behaviour

\item Path of the tornado shows stronger reflectivity (in this case the radar beam was under the pyroCb)
\item Movement of the tornado is along the centerline of the fire plume. (support the idea that the tornado was indeed a pyrogenic event)

\item Production of intense firewirls is believed to be a function of the interation of the rate of energy release and the degree of atmospheric instability in the 1000 to 3000 m layer
\item Fire whirls need available vorticity close to form
\item Two types of fire whirl observed: 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Type 1: Whirlinds formed in pair in the leeward side of the convective column. Vorticity is tilted to match the vertical motion field of the column
	\item Type 2: Entire column goes in rotation and lead to large whirls. Cause is likely to be stretching of existing vertical vorticity adveted from the surroundings or result of buoyancy.

\raggedright Review of vortices in wildland fire & J Forthofer & 2011 & \raggedleft 
\begin{itemize} 
\item Fire whirls characterized by sudden formation, erratic movement, often sudden dissipation. Definition: vertically oriented, intensely rotating column of gas found in or near fires.
\item Contribution to the formation of firewhirls:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Lee slope
	\item Superadiabatic or dry lapse rate in the atmoshere (big decrease of temerature with height)
	\item Vorticity associated with passage of a cold front
	\end{itemize}
\item Range varies between 10m-3km and 10m/s-100m/s for the wind velocity
\item Can be strong enough to move over 1000m away from the fire and lift a house
\item Formation of a firewhirl requires ambient vorticity and a concentrating mechanism (buoyancy flow from the fire)
\item Reduction by one order of magnitude of the tubulent mixing (due to a balance between radial gradient pressure with the low pressure in the core and centrifuge acceleration), increasing flame lenght and burning rate.
\item cyclostrophic flow reached above the ground. Near the ground, drag force cut the cyclostrophic balance, the main flow is then due to the pressure gradient and fuel/gas are draggged toward the core and then lifted.
